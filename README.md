# Password Purgatory in Go

This is essentially a copy of the [password purgatory api](https://github.com/troyhunt/password-purgatory-api)
by [Troy Hunt](https://www.troyhunt.com/) as described in his [blog post](https://www.troyhunt.com/building-password-purgatory-with-cloudflare-pages-and-workers/).
I really liked the idea and used it to hone my skills at deploying an API in go,
rather than javascript, and to [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) rather
than to [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/). I encourage you
to look into Troy Hunt's original project rather than here if you are interested
in his work.
